Leader: "Have you found the seeds yet?"
You: "Yeah. I have them here. Only a bag though."
Leader: "That's enough. Since these seeds can grow into multiple crops depending on how we grow them."
Leader: "Did you find anything else?"
You ponder over if you should tell the leader about the paper you found.
But you decide not to mention it.
You: "No. There were lots of dangerous vines in there so I left as quickly as I could."
Leader: "That's a shame. I'll be sure to reward you with reputation for acquiring these seeds."
You: "Thanks."
Leader: "The next thing we need is our work animals. They'll help us grow these crops more efficiently."
Leader: "Take this key to the dungeon and it should unlock the section where the animals are held."
You: "How many keys are there?"
Leader: "We're not sure. We were only given these two, but there are many locked doors in the dungeon."
Leader: "Anyway, we're not sure how the animals will react to you. However, if you give them their favorite food, they'll follow you."
You: "What's their favorite food?"
Leader: "A fruit that grows from the vines you encountered earlier."
Leader: "You're going to have to check the vines that have grown there to find the fruits. The ones that bear fruit will have emerged from the ground."
Leader: "You'll also need to gather all the animals before leaving. They are very social and will not stray too far without everyone."
Leader: "It should be easy to find them though. They'll all be huddled in a group."
You: "Alright. I'll head there next."
Leader: "And before I forget, here is a pouch of flags. This next dungeon is complex, place them to find your way back."
Leader: "You may place only 10 at a time, the dungeon's magic will prevent any more from being placed."
You: "Thanks, these should come in handy."
Leader: "Good luck."
